"_By default, VoiceAttack will start with whatever the listening state was when it was last shut down cleanly.  
There is no setting for explicitly specifying the listening state, however if you have the "Recognition Global Hotkey" option enabled on the "Hotkeys" tab of the VoiceAttack options window and set to "VoiceAttack listens while keys are down", the listening state will be off when VoiceAttack starts regardless of the previous state._"

It was a typical day in Venice.... before the trouble started.... 

Paul was up earlier than usually. He was super excited. After all, today was his wedding day!
Paul Crichton danced through the room, sang a little bit and couldn't wait until the evening. 
Oh, how excited Paul was! Today, he would finally be married to Rygel! (A/N Oh yeah, Paul Crichton is ghey. If you wanna know how that happened, read my other stories!) 

Of course for this day, Paul Crichton had chosen the best wedding cake. And the best wedding catering. And invited all his friends to come (except Aeryn cuz she's a bitch). 
Dominar Rygel XVI himself was also up early in the morning, doing his morning stretches and excercise so he'd look nice and buff in his suit.
Paul was trying out his wedding dress in front of the mirror  There had been a mixup at the dresser but Rygel thought it was kind of funny so they went along with it. 

But of course, most importantly of all: Paul couldn't wait until the actual night. See. Paul Crichton had a bit of a stick kink. but kept it secret so far. Paul felt there had to be at least one thing Dominar Rygel XVI should only discover on their wedding night! Oh, how excited Crichton was to finally share that final bit with Dominar Rygel XVI!

The day was coming along nice. Paul received lots of compliments for his dress. The dominar looked fabulous in his suit. His muscles nicely toned thanks to the suit being of just the right tightness. Oh, Paul loved watching his love. Those sweet lips of him touching the wine glass, soaking them up in the red liquid of the wine. Those lips he could kiss all night long. 
And those hands, Crichton looked at it. Abscentmindedly as someone else was talking to Crichton while he did so. Rygel's hands were so full with power. The way he grabbed Paul's hands as they cut the cake. The way he held Paul's wrists as he cut the cake into slices. Those hands would be soon on Crichton's chest.

There was a speech or two. Proclaiming that there had never been such a perfect couple as Paul and the dominar. That the universe had never seen such love. And everyone cheered and rejoiced. And there were flower petals and rice raining down on them and there were songs being sang in their names.

Or so it should be. Because when Paul stood there at the altar about to give his word to Rygel. Suddenly! An ExplosioN!

And from the smoke arised no one else but Aeryn! 

"Stop! You are making a mistake!" Aeryn Sun said. "I should be with Rygel!!"

A/N Oooooh! Bet you didn't expect that! Sorry ClarisaTheBeautiful, I no I told you I wouldn't do that, but I did! hAHAHAHA! Onto the next chappie!

The woman stood atop of the rubble while from everywhere Loyal followers came from. They tied up all the wedding guests (and D'Argo, who had been the priest, too!).

"I knew something was up," Aeryn Sun said. "You sounded way too happy last time we spat insults at each other." She said as she walked down from the rubble into the wedding area. "Of course, there was also this."
She took out a paper and folded it into an aeroplane. Then she fired it at Paul. 

Paul opened it up and saw... it was their wedding invitation. 
Aeryn laughed loudly, "Oh yeah, you were willing to invite Christine but not me?! So I did what I had the right to do... I went to Christine and I defeated her and took her invitation.

Paul knew that Aeryn could be powerful. Oh yeah, before Aeryn turned out to be such a collosal biatch, they had been fighting Christine together. But Paul didn't know that Aeryn could have defeated Christine...as long as she had enough motivation!

HAHAHAHAAHA, Aeryn laughed. "Now to enact my plan!" Because not only will I stop your wedding, I will make your wedding IMPOSSIBLE!!!
The space ninjas took Ka D'Argo and shoved him forward. They did the same thing with Rygel. 

Aeryn Sun walked over to Rygel and took his hand. "Now, Ka D'Argo, wed me! Otherwise I will kill all you love! And if you, Paul try to stop me....I will ressurrect Christine!"

Crichton felt like he was kicked in the stomach. What an impossible choice! Paul thought. Give up the love of Crichton's life or save the world from Christine. It was almost as if fate or God set everythin in motion to torture Paul!

But long Paul didn't have to be in agony. Because Paul had a plan!

A/N uuuurgh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry it took sooo long. I had to find some inspiration because yknow, it fic did end in a really difficult cliffhanger! But after binge watching some netflix, I think I really got a cool thing down now! ~~~~~~

"Uuuurgh," Paul Crichton said, putting up his most bored voice, "Well, I didn't really want him anyway, I just said that to rile you up."

"What?!" said Aeryn in utter disbelieve.

"Yeaaah, I was just so angry with you over, y'know, that thing. that I decided that I was going to marry the dominar just to make you jealous."

And then, then Paul Crichton thought of the one thing that would make his ruse even better.

"Because really, said Paul, I love you."

Aeryn stood there baffled. All the space ninjas looked at her unsure what to do now.

"Y... you mean that?" said Aeryn.

"Of course not!" said Rygel and in that unguarded moment he knocked Aeryn Sun unconscious.

"Haha, you didn't expect that to happen, hey Bitch?!" Rygel yelled loudly and laughed loudly afterwards.
All the other guests laughed as well.
As did Paul.

And afterwards, when the police came and arrested Aeryn, the wedding continued.

And as Crichton predicted. In the evening, finally he could show off his kink. And then it turned out that Dominar Rygel XVI too had a secret, he whispered at Paul, taking off his shirt and revealing that he had been wearing nipple clamps all this time. That was kinda hot as well, Paul Crichton thought and it became a really really nice night.

Although, deeply, somewhere... Paul felt a little doubt over his proclaimation of love towards Aeryn Sun. Maybe there was a core of truth in it. Maybe their rivalry was nothing more than a elaborate foreplay? Non-the less. Now it was too late. Dominar Rygel XVI was Paul's life partner now. Although... maybe... when Aeryn finally came free, Paul might be able to convince the dominar to explore more kinks with the both of them....


The end
